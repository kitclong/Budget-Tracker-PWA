## About Budget-Tracker-PWA

The purpose of this educational assignment was to practice developing progressive web applications (PWA) with NoSQL databases using mongoose and MongoDB, by creating and deploying a budget tracker.

1. Present user with homepage to create a budget.
2. User can add or subtract a budget amount by entering a 'transaction name' and 'transaction amount'.
3. Users are then able to click 'add funds' or 'subtract funds' to manipulate the budget.
